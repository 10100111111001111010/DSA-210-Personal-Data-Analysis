# Screen Time and Academic Performance Analysis

## Introduction
Have you ever said "tomorrow is the first day of my new life"? Well, I did - many times actually, and the last time I said this was November 19, 2023. This project analyzes my journey of self-improvement by examining two key metrics: screen time usage and academic performance. Through data science techniques, I aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights about how my habits have evolved since making that commitment to change.

By combining screen time data from my devices with my academic performance records, this analysis will explore whether my digital behavior changes correlate with academic outcomes, potentially revealing insights about productivity patterns and study habits. This personal data-driven approach allows me to quantitatively assess my progress and identify areas for continued improvement.
