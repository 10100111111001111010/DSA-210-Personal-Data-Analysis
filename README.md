## Introduction
In today's digital age, YouTube has become an integral part of our daily lives, serving as a platform for entertainment, education, and information. This project aims to analyze my personal YouTube viewing habits using data collected through Google Takeout. By examining my viewing patterns and preferences, I seek to gain insights into my digital content consumption behaviors and understand how they reflect my interests and time management.
