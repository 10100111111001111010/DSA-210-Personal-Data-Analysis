# Screen Time and Academic Performance Analysis

## Introduction
Have you ever said "tomorrow is the first day of my new life"? Well, I did - many times actually, and the last time I said this was November 19, 2023. This project analyzes my journey of self-improvement by examining two key metrics: screen time usage and academic performance. Through data science techniques, I aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights about how my habits have evolved since making that commitment to change.

By combining screen time data from my devices with my academic performance records, this analysis will explore whether my digital behavior changes correlate with academic outcomes, potentially revealing insights about productivity patterns and study habits. This personal data-driven approach allows me to quantitatively assess my progress and identify areas for continued improvement.


# Dataset

1. Screen Time Data
- Daily usage statistics from mobile devices and laptop (Nov 2023 - Jan 2024)
- App-specific usage duration
- Time of day patterns 
- App category breakdowns (social, productivity, entertainment)

2. Academic Performance Data
- Academic transcripts from university portal

The data will be preprocessed to create a unified dataset combining daily screen time metrics with corresponding academic performance indicators. This integrated dataset will enable analysis of potential correlations between digital habits and academic outcomes.


# Project Goals

1. Analyze correlation between screen time patterns and academic performance
  - Identify any relationship between app usage and grades
  - Determine peak productivity hours based on app usage patterns
  - Evaluate impact of entertainment app usage on study effectiveness

2. Measure behavioral changes since November 19, 2023
  - Track reduction in non-productive screen time
  - Monitor increases in study-related app usage
  - Assess improvements in time management
